- **Product Filtering & Search**: Filter products by category and search by keywords.
- **Product Detail Pages**: Dedicated pages for each product with more detailed information.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Simulated Checkout**: A basic checkout flow to demonstrate order processing.
